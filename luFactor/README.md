# LU FACTORIZATION

# Description of Function
This function utilizes LU Factorization with partial pivoting. It can be used for things such as linear algebra. It will take a coefficient matrix of values as its input and then display things such as the lower triangular matrix, upper triangular matrix, and the permutation matrix. 


# Inputs
A- Coefficient Matrix




# Outputs
L = lower triangular matrix

U = upper triangular matrix

P = the permutation matrix



# Special Notes About Function
This function error checks to make sure that this is a square matrix. 

This function starts with an identity matrix and runs through a series of test.
