# Linear Regression


# Description Of Function
This function takes a data set that has as input values and output values. It then filters the data sets and discards any outliers. It then finds the slope and y intercept of the linear regression line through the data set using the normal equations. The normal equations remember are not y=mx+b it is something a little more advanced. It then finds the St or the total sum of the squares of the residuals about the mean. As well as the Sr which is the sum of the squares of the residuals about the regression.It then uses those to determine the coefficient of determination(R^2). 



# Inputs
x- x-values for our data set

y-y-values for our data set



# Outputs
fX-x-values with outliers removed

fY-y-values with outliers removed

slope-slope from the linear regression y=mx+b
 
intercept-intercept from the linear regression y=mx+b

Rsquared-R^2 (coefficient of determination)



# Special Notes of Function
The arrays of data must be the same size in order for this function to work.
